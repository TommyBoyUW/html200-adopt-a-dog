Testing was performed on the following site:

 Testing approach and findings are as follows:

 Testing and development was originally performed on a 15" PC laptop using Windows 10, Atom and Google Chrome, google dev tools and the window resizer extension. During development, media query breakpoints were tested using the google chrome window resizer emulator to ensure proportional layout on handheld devices, iPad/tablet devices as well as larger laptop and desktop devices. After development and testing with Google Chrome and the emulator extension, the Firefox and Edge web browsers were utilized to verify output which was hosted on GitHub. The initial layout was analyzed for consistency among the web browsers. I tested the responsiveness by maximizing and minimizing the web page ensuring that the font and alignment did not get distorted when resizing the page as well as assuring the font was proportional to the page at different sizes. Coding the font in % or EM/REM instead of hard coded pixel count size allowed for a more responsive and proportional design. All of the links, pictures and hover effects work as expected.

 The next step was to run the website on an available Apple macbook using the Safari, Google Chrome and Firefox web browsers. A similar approach was taken to review the overall layout and responsiveness of the website. Initial loading and scrolling appears to be as expected resulting in a consistent layout and smooth scrolling. The next step was to minimize/maximize the webpage to look at its responsiveness and to make sure none of the content was falling off the page. Resizing the browser window to evaluate small, medium and large display types resulted in proportional and appropriate sizing of content on different emulated devices. The links all work and no issues were noted.

 The final step was to evaluate the website on an iPhone using Safari. While using the iPhone emulators on PC resulted in no issues it became apparent after initial page load that some of the text and the button margins did not line up, the button text spilled over the box. Corrective actions for this issue include evaluating the margin size and text as well as evaluating for another breakpoint for smaller screen sizes. Another issue that was discovered was the hover on image function would stick after tapping on an image. This was an unanticipated exception to the results of the emulator testing since the emulator also included the use of a mouse which is not an option on a mobile device that relies on touch screen interaction. This issue will need to be addressed either by excluding hover responses on certain breakpoints or exploring additional options due to the different interfaces used. Other than these findings, the website behaved as expected such as the forms page and options behaving as expected, adopting submit buttons performing as expected and page load response time being acceptable.
